  The publish config allows you to customize the ANT scripts that can be run
  by the publish engine. Using <publishing override="true"> will replace all
  default actions with these otherwise they are added.
  
  Each <action> should include:
  - @type         = the type of action - import|export|publish|process|upload|upload-preview
  - <source>      = what source object this action applies to
     @type        = the type of source - group|folder|document
     @extension   = the filename extension of the source (only applies to document)
  - <target>      = each target in the ANT script the user can run
     @name        = the name of the target
     @perspective = only display target in this perspective (optional)
  
  Each <target> should include:
  - <description> = a description of this action for the user interface
  - <param>       = each parameter the user can specify
     @type        = the type of value - text|date|number|checkbox|select
     @label       = the label for the user interface
     (see documentation for more optional attributes/elements)
